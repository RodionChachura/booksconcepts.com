While reading this book, I wrote down the main concepts from it. You may find them useful if you just finished reading audiobook or want to refresh knowledge. Also, these notes can help you to decide — want you to read this book or not.

### Why a Book About Passion

*   Focusing on performance practices alone misses a crucial point. All the greats shared something else in common: An unrelenting drive. An eternal hunger. An inability to be satiated. Passion.
*   When you are deep in the throes of a passion, when you’re really going for something, it can seem as if nothing else matters. This can be a good thing, a bad thing, or, more often than not, a bit of both at the same time.

### Passion Must Be Handled with Care

*   Consider just a few of the negative paths that passion can lead you down: you become a slave to external results and validation; you become blind to everything but your passion; you burn out; you lose joy.
*   Passion is fragile, and it must be handled with care. This is why research shows that passion isn’t just linked to happiness, health, performance, and life satisfaction, but also to anxiety, depression, burnout, and unethical behavior.
*   Finding your passion is only half the battle anyway. Knowing how to sustain and channel it in a productive and healthy manner is the other — and equally important — half.

### The Origins of Passion

*   In many ways, passion and suffering are still very much connected.
*   When you’re under passion’s spell, the reward you think you’re chasing — usually some sort of contentment or satiation — is merely an illusion. We don’t get hooked on the feeling associated with achievement, we get hooked on the feeling associated with the chase.
*   We’re not wired to simply be content. We’re wired to keep pushing.
*   The line between what we consider a destructive addiction and a productive passion is a fine one, if such a line exists at all.
*   There is a biological reason why the wonderful feeling of passion cannot coexist with the wonderful feeling of contentment. Passion builds on itself: the more we push, the more we get hooked on the feeling of pushing.
*   Throwing ourselves wholly into a passion shrinks our world, overshadowing whatever inner struggles we may be facing and making us feel comfortable and in control. Our obsessions become a refuge. Places where we can fill the voids created by other insufficiencies in our lives. A chance to flee from the chaos and quiet the noise.
*   Passionate pursuits often become psychological refuges, allowing you to hide from areas of your life that may be lacking: this can be both productive (keeps you from turning to destructive behaviors) and at the same time damaging (keeps you from confronting underlying issues).
*   Individuals we praise for passion — who go on to experience huge successes — are often those who have a found a way to turn what could be seen as biological and psychological weaknesses into strengths.

### Find and Grow Your Passion

*   A better approach to finding your passion is to lower the bar from perfect to interesting, then give yourself permission to pursue your interests with an open mind.
*   Especially when first exploring new ideas and activities, don’t let perfect be the enemy of good.
*   Interest is an invitation to exploration, drawing your attention toward activities that have the potential to grow into something greater. But that can only occur if you accept the invitation.
