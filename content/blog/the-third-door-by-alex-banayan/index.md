While reading this book, I wrote down the main concepts from it. You may find them useful if you just finished reading audiobook or want to refresh knowledge. Also, these notes can help you to decide — want you to read this book or not.

### STEP 1: DITCH THE LINE

Life, business, success…it’s just like a nightclub.

There are always three ways in.

There’s the First Door: the main entrance, where the line curves around the block; where 99 percent of people wait around, hoping to get in.

There’s the Second Door: the VIP entrance, where the billionaires, celebrities, and the people born into it slip through.

But what no one tells you is that **there is always, always…the Third Door**. It’s the entrance where you have to jump out of line, run down the alley, bang on the door a hundred times, crack open the window, sneak through the kitchen — there’s always a way. Whether it’s how Bill Gates sold his first piece of software or how Steven Spielberg became the youngest studio director in Hollywood history, they all took…the Third Door.

### STEP 2: RUN DOWN THE ALLEY

#### Spielberg Game

1.  Jump off the tour bus.
2.  Find an Inside Man.
3.  Ask for his or her help to bring you in.

The most important step was finding that “Inside Man” — someone inside organization willing to put his or her reputation on the line to bring you in.

#### Qi Lu

Luck is like a bus if you miss one, there’s always the next one. But if you’re not prepared, you won’t be able to jump on.

#### Sugar Ray

I didn’t have the experience, but I had the heart, the discipline, and the desire.

You may have a desire, a wish, a dream — but it’s got to be more than that — you’ve got to want it to the point that it hurts. Most people never reach that point. They never tap into what I call the **Hidden Reservoir**, your hidden reserve of strength. **We all have it**.

Don’t let anyone tell you your dream isn’t possible. When you have a vision, you’ve got to hang in there. You’ve got to stay in the fight. It’s going to get tough. You’re going to hear no. But you’ve got to keep pushing. You’ve got to keep fighting. You’ve got to use your Hidden Reservoir. It’s not going to be easy, but it’s possible.

### STEP 3: FIND YOUR INSIDE MAN

#### Elliot Rules

1.  Never use your phone in a meeting. Using your phone makes you look like a chump. Always carry a pen in your pocket. The more digital the world gets, the more impressive it is to use a pen. And anyway, if you’re in a meeting, it’s just rude to be on your phone.
2.  Act like you belong. Walk into a room like you’ve been there before. Don’t gawk over celebrities. Be cool. Be calm. And never, ever ask someone for a picture. **If you want to be treated like a peer, you need to act like one.**
3.  Mystery makes history. When you’re doing cool shit, don’t post pictures of it on Facebook. No one actually changing the world posts everything they do online. Keep people guessing what you’re up to. Plus, **the people you’re going to impress by posting things online aren’t the people you should care about impressing.**
4.  Never, ever go back on your word. This goes of your relationships with everyone from this day forward. If you act like a vault, people will treat you like a vault. **It will take years to build your reputation, but seconds to ruin it.**
5.  Adventures only happen to the adventurous.

Never again will you sit in a meeting with someone and not tell them that. Your mission is nice, but this story tells me more about who you are than anything else you could possibly say. This story commands attention.

Everybody has experiences in their lives, some choose to make them into stories.

I had no idea what I was doing. Ever since then, I’ve lived my life by one motto: Bite off more than you can chew. You can figure out how to chew later.

What your story is about isn’t as important as how you tell it.

You have to go for it, even if there’s a chance you’ll fail. The planets are never going to perfectly align. When you see an opportunity, it’s up to you to jump.

You see, most people live a linear life. They go to college, get an internship, graduate, land a job, get a promotion, save up for a vacation each year, work toward their next promotion, and they just do that their whole lives. Their lives move step by step, slowly and predictably. But successful people don’t buy into that model. They opt into an exponential life. Rather than going step by step, they skip steps. People say that you first need to ‘pay your dues’ and get years of experience before you can go out on your own and get what you truly want. Society feeds us this lie that you need to do x, y, and z before you can achieve your dream. It’s bullshit. **The only person whose permission you need to live an exponential life is your own.**

### Tony Hsieh

— Why don’t you let your employees shadow you? (Alex)

— I’d be happy to — but no one ever asks. (Tony)

### STEP 4: TRUDGE THROUGH THE MUD

#### Warren Buffet

Buffet is famous for being a long-term value investor and this story shows he treated his career the same way. He could’ve gotten a high-paying job right out of school and made far more money in the short term. But by offering to work for free under Graham, he set himself up to make much more in the long term. Instead of trying to get paid as much as possible in dollars, **Buffet chose to get paid in mentorship, expertise, and connections.**

— It’s like what Elliott told me, One path leads to a linear life, the other an exponential. (Alex)

When everyone else skims a report, Buffet is obsessively scouring the fine print, going above and beyond, studying every word, looking for clues. You don’t have to be born a genius to read the footnotes — it’s a choice. It’s a choice. It’s a choice to put in the hours, go the extra mile, and do the things others aren’t willing to do. Reading the dam footnotes isn’t just a task on Buffet’s to-do list — it’s his outlook on life.

#### Dean Kamen

Instead of getting frustrated by repeating the same old problem reframe the question in a new way that is amenable to a different kind of solution.

#### Charlie Munger

The best way to raise money before you have a track record is to do it from people who already believe in you and trust you, because they’ve seen you do other things in the past. Those people can be family, friends, college professors, former bosses, or even the parents of your friends.

It’s hard to do when you’re young, and that’s why people smart so small.

#### Larry King

— If you were starting out today, what would you do? (Alex)

— Same thing, I’d knock on doors. I’d knock on whatever doors I’d have to. There’d be many more places to knock. And look — nothing is new. We have the Internet, but nothing is new except the transmission. Human nature hasn’t changed.” (Larry)

#### Cal Fussman

People like human beings. People don’t like random names in their inbox.
