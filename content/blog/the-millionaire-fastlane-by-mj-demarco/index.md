### “The Millionaire Fastlane” by MJ DeMarco

While reading this book, I wrote down the main concepts from it. You may find them useful if you just finished listening audiobook or want to refresh knowledge. Also, these notes can help you to decide — want you to read this book or not.

### Wealth in a Wheelchair… “Get Rich Slow” is Get Rich Old

*   “Get Rich Slow”: Go to school, get good grades, graduate, get a good job, save 10%, invest in the stock market, max your 401k, slash your credit cards, and clip coupons…then, someday, when you are, oh, 65 years old, you will be rich.
*   If you want to retire young with health, vibrancy, and hair, you’re going to need to ignore society’s default “Get Rich Slow” roadmap and the gurus spoon-feeding you the slop in the trough. There is another way.
*   Fast wealth is created exponentially, not linearly.

### Wealth is Not a Road, But a Road Trip

*   When your focus is only the road, your journey is likely to stall and dreamy destinations never arrive.
*   All self-made multimillionaires create their wealth by a carefully orchestrated **process**. They have and use the entire **formula**.
*   All events of wealth are precluded by **process**, a backstory of trial, risk, hard work, and sacrifice. If you try to skip process, you’ll never experience events.
