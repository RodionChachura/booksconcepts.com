#### Chapter 1: THE COMPOUND EFFECT IN ACTION

*   The Compound Effect is the principle of reaping huge rewards from a series of small, smart choices.
*   Small, Smart Choices + Consistency + Time = RADICAL DIFFERENCE
*   The reality is that even one small change can have a significant impact that causes an unexpected and unintended ripple effect.
*   The most challenging aspect of the Compound Effect is that we have to keep working away for a while, consistently and efficiently, before we can begin to see the payoff.
*   Your only path to success is through a continuum of mundane, unsexy, unexciting, and sometimes difficult daily disciplines compounded over time.

#### Chapter 2: CHOICES

*   After that grand entrance, the life we end up with is simply an accumulation of all the choices we make.
*   You make your choices, and then your choices make you.
*   If I always took 100 percent responsibility for everything I experienced — completely owning all of my choices and all the ways I responded to whatever happened to me — I held the power. Everything was up to me.
*   The (Complete) Formula for Getting Lucky:  
    Preparation (personal growth) +  
    Attitude (belief/mindset) +  
    Opportunity (a good thing coming your way) +  
    Action (doing something about it) =  
    Luck
*   The day you graduate from childhood to adulthood is the day you  
    take full responsibility for your life.
*   Become very conscious of every choice you make today so you can begin to make smarter choices moving forward.
*   At any given moment, I want you to know exactly how well you’re doing. I’m asking you to track yourself as if you’re a valuable commodity. Because you are. I’m asking you to start tracking. Doing so will revolutionize your life, and ultimately, your lifestyle.

#### Chapter 3: HABITS

*   With enough practice and repetition, any behavior, good or bad, becomes automatic over time.
*   Assuming willpower is what you need to change your habits is akin to trying to keep a hungry grizzly bear out of your picnic basket by covering the it with a napkin.
*   Your choices are only meaningful when you connect them to your desires and dreams.
*   If you are not making the progress that you would like to make and are capable of making, it is simply because your goals are not clearly defined.
*   If you really want to maintain a good habit, make sure you pay attention to it at least once a day, and you’re far more likely to succeed.
*   There is a one thing that 99 percent of “failures” and “successful” folks have in common — they all hate doing the same things. The difference is successful people do them anyway.

#### Chapter 4: MOMENTUM

*   Everything just wants to stay at rest. You’ll need a lot of energy to break your inertia and get your new enterprise under way. But once you get momentum, you will be hard to stop — virtually unbeatable — even though you’re now putting out considerably less effort while receiving greater results.
*   It’s not easy to build momentum, but once you do, look out!

#### Chapter 5: INFLUENCES

*   For you to sustain your positive trajectory toward your goals, you’ll need to understand and govern these influences so they will support rather than derail your journey toward success.
*   Everyone is affected by three kinds of influences: **input** (what you feed your mind), **associations**(the people with whom you spend time), and **environment**(your surroundings).
*   If you want your body to run at peak performance, you’ve got to be vigilant about consuming the highest-quality nutrients and avoiding tempting junk food. If you want your brain to perform at its peak, you’ve got to be even more vigilant about what you feed it.
*   We become the combined average of the five people we hang around the most.
*   You cannot hang out with negative people and expect to live a positive life.
*   Want real feedback? Find people who care enough about you to be brutally honest with you.
*   you will get in life what you accept and expect you are worthy of.

#### Chapter 6: ACCELERATION

*   There is a point in every race when a rider encounters his real opponent and understands that it’s himself
*   Common things deliver common results
*   Find the line of expectation and then exceed it.
*   In all areas of your life, look for the multiplier opportunities where you can go a little further, push yourself a little harder, last a little longer, prepare a little better, and deliver a little bit more.

#### CONCLUSION

*   Motivation without action leads to self-delusion.
*   Whatever I want in life, I’ve found that the best way to get it is to  
    focus my energy on giving to others.
