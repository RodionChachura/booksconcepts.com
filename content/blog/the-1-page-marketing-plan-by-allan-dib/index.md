### INTRODUCTION

If you didn’t go into business to make money then you’re either lying or you have a hobby, not a business.

The owner of the business may have excellent technical skills but it’s his lack of business skills that causes his business to fail.

Invariably when someone makes a mess of something it often becomes clear in the aftermath that they didn’t have a plan. Don’t let that be you and your business. While no one can guarantee your success, **having a plan dramatically increases your probability of success**.

the Pareto Principle predicts that **80% of effects come from 20% of causes**.

By far **the biggest leverage point in any business is marketing**. If you get 10% better at marketing, this can have an exponential or multiplying effect on the bottom line.

**Marketing** is the **strategy** you use for getting your ideal target market to know you, like and trust you enough to become a customer. All the stuff you usually associate with marketing are **tactics**.

You need both strategy and tactics to be successful but strategy must come first and it dictates the tactics you use. This is where your marketing plan comes in. Think of your marketing plan as the architect’s blueprint for getting and retaining customers.

A good product or service is a **customer retention** tool. If we give our customers a great product or service experience they’ll buy more from us, they’ll refer other people to us and build up the brand through positive word of mouth. However, before customer retention, we need to think about **customer acquisition** (AKA marketing). The most successful entrepreneurs always start with marketing.

Branding, mass marketing and ego-based marketing is the domain of large companies. To achieve any kind of cut through requires an enormous budget and the use of expensive mass media.

**Direct response marketing** is designed to evoke an immediate response and compel prospects to take some specific action, such as opting-in to your email list, picking up the phone and calling for more information, placing an order or being directed to a web page. So what makes a direct response ad? Here are some of the main characteristics:

1.  It’s trackable.
2.  It’s measurable.
3.  It uses compelling headlines and sales copy.
4.  It targets a specific audience or niche.
5.  It makes a specific offer.
6.  It demands a response.
7.  Multi-step, short-term follow-up.
8.  Maintenance follow-up of unconverted leads.

Direct response marketing is a very deep topic with many facets. **The 1-Page Marketing Plan** is a tool that helps you implement direct response marketing in your business without needing to spend years studying to become an expert.

<figcaption>The Three Phases Of The Marketing Journey</figcaption></figure>

### ACT I — The “Before” Phase

In the “before” phase you’re dealing with prospects. **Prospects** are people that may not even yet know you exist. In this phase you’ll identify a target market, craft a compelling message for this target market and deliver your message to them through advertising media.

The goal of this phase is to get your prospect to know you and respond to your message. Once they’ve indicated interest by responding, they become a lead and enter the second phase of your marketing process.

#### **Chapter 1 — Selecting Your Target Market**

Selecting your target market is a crucial first step in the marketing process. Doing so will ensure your marketing message resonates better, which in turn will make your marketing far more effective. By focusing on the **right target market** for your business, you’ll be able to get a better return on the time, money and energy you invest.

To be a successful small business marketer you need laser-like focus on a narrow target market, sometimes called a **niche**.

Now you may be thinking why on earth would we want to limit our market so much? Here’s why:

1.  **You have a limited amount of money**. If you focus too broadly, your marketing message will become diluted and weak.
2.  **The other critical factor is relevance**. The goal of your ad is for your prospects to say, Hey that’s for me.

Targeting a tight niche allows you to become a big fish in a small pond. It allows you to dominate a category or geography in a way that is impossible by being general.

Dominate a niche, then once you own it, do the same with another and then another. But never do so all at once. Doing so dilutes your message and your marketing power.

A great way of figuring out your ideal target market is to use the **PVP** (Personal fulfillment, Value to the marketplace and Profitability) and giving each market segment you serve a rating out of 10.

**P — Personal fulfillment**: How much do you enjoy dealing with this type of customer? Here you rate how much you enjoy working with this market segment.

**V — Value To The Marketplace**: How much does this market segment value your work? Are they willing to pay you a lot of $$$ for your work?

**P — Profitability**: How profitable is the work you do for this market segment?

One of the best tools for getting into the mind of your prospect is to temporarily become them by creating an avatar.

An **avatar** is a detailed exploration and description of your target customer and their lives. It helps tell their story so that you can visualize life from their perspective.

#### Chapter 2 — Crafting Your Message

Most marketing messages are boring, timid and ineffective. To stand out from the crowd you need to craft a **compelling message** that grabs the attention of your target market. Once you have their attention, the goal of your message is to compel them to respond.

To start marketing on purpose we need to look at two vital elements:

1.  What Is The Purpose Of Your Ad?
2.  What Does Your Ad Focus On?

My rule of thumb is **one ad, one objective**. If something in the ad isn’t helping you achieve that objective then it’s detracting from it and you should get rid of it.

Even the most experienced marketer will tell you they hardly ever hit a homerun on their first go. It takes several iterations. It takes testing and measuring to finally get your message to market and media match right.

Marketing is an uphill battle if you haven’t clearly clarified first in your mind why your business exists and why people should buy from you rather than your nearest competitor.

You need to develop your **unique selling proposition (USP)**.

The two questions you must ask and answer are:

1.  Why should they buy?
2.  Why should they buy from me?

So to get into the mind of the prospect, we need to discover what result they are actually buying. Once you understand this, you then need to craft your unique selling proposition based on the result your prospects want to achieve.

Understand that your prospect has essentially three options:

1.  Buy from you.
2.  Buy from your competitor.
3.  Do nothing.

By charging higher prices, you attract a better quality client. As counterintuitive as it may seem, you get far less grief from high-end customers than you do from low-end ones.

A great way of distilling your USP is by crafting an “elevator pitch.” An **elevator pitch** is a concise, well-rehearsed summary of your business and its value proposition which can be delivered in the time span of an elevator ride, i.e. 30–90 seconds.

Bad marketing is highly product-focused and self-focused. Good marketing, especially direct response marketing, is always customer and problem/solution focused, and that’s exactly how we want our elevator pitch to be. We want to be remembered for what problem we solve rather than for some impressive but incomprehensible title or business.

So how do you effectively communicate these three components in the space of thirty or so seconds? The best formula I’ve seen is:

**You know \[problem\]? Well what we do is \[solution\]. In fact \[proof\].**

Remember if you don’t give your ideal target market a reason why your offer is different, they will default to price as the main criteria for making their decision.

Two great questions to think about when you’re crafting your offer are:

1.  Of all the products and services you offer, which do you have the most confidence in delivering?
2.  Of all the products and services you offer, which do you enjoy delivering the most?

The offer is one of the most important parts of your marketing campaign and you need to spend much of your time and energy on structuring this correctly.

One of the easiest methods of finding out what your prospects want is simply by asking them. You can do so through a survey or through more formal market research.

It should also be noted that most people don’t know what they want until they’ve actually been presented with it. Also when people are doing surveys or responding to market research, they do so with logic; however, when it comes to actual purchasing, this is done with emotions and justified with logic after the fact. So you need to supplement asking with observing.

Now that you know what your market wants, you need to package it up and present it as an irresistible offer. Here are some of the essential elements:

*   Value
*   Language
*   Reason Why
*   Value Stacking
*   Upsells
*   Payment Plan
*   Guarantee
*   Scarcity

Selling features and benefits is the best way to turn your prospects into price shoppers who view your product as a commodity bought solely on price. Your goal is to be a problem solver, pain reliever and turn any comparison with your competition into an apples-to-oranges comparison. Remember people are much more willing to pay for a cure than for prevention. Targeting existing pain rather than promising future pleasure will result in much higher conversion, much higher customer satisfaction and lower price resistance. Look for pain points in your industry and become the source of relief.

Almost no other skill will reward you more richly than the ability to write compelling words. Being able to clearly articulate why a prospect should buy from you rather than your competitors in a way that creates an emotion and motivates them to action is the master skill of marketing.

Copywriting is salesmanship in print. You need to write your sales copy as though you were talking directly to a single person.

A one word change in your headline can dramatically alter the results you achieve. Always remember, people buy with emotions first and then justify with logic afterwards. Trying to sell to their logical brain with facts and figures is a complete waste of time.

Fear, especially the fear of loss is one of the most powerful emotional hot buttons you can push in your sales copy. Understanding how certain words link to certain emotions is powerful.

An emotional hot button for one type of target audience will fall on deaf ears to another audience. Emotional direct response copywriting is no substitute for understanding EXACTLY who your target audience is and what their emotional triggers are.

Research is often the most neglected component of copywriting and is the major reason why even powerful copy can sometimes fail. Emotional direct response copywriting is a powerful tool in your marketing arsenal. But understand it is part of a process. Research, write, then test and measure and you’ll be far ahead of 99.9% of all your competitors.

Part of the job of good sales copy is to tell potential prospects who your product or service is NOT for.

Title should equal content. In other words if the name doesn’t make it automatically obvious what the product, service or business is, then you’re starting from behind.

Always choose clarity over cleverness. It’s hard enough to get a message read, understood then acted upon at the best of times. But intentionally adding confusion into the mix when you’re a small business with a modest marketing budget is madness.

#### Chapter 3 — Reaching Prospects With Advertising Media

Advertising media is the vehicle you’ll use to reach your target market and communicate your message. It’s typically the most expensive component of your marketing, so it needs to be selected and managed carefully to ensure you get a good return on investment (ROI).

Tools such as toll-free numbers, website analytics and coupon codes make this trivial. Remember what gets measured, gets managed. Be ruthless with your ad spend by cutting the losers and riding the winners. Obviously, to know what’s losing and what’s winning, you need to be **tracking and measuring**.

Hire experts that specialize in whatever media you decide is right for your campaign — they’re worth their weight in gold. Don’t try and do it yourself, especially when it comes to the most expensive part of your marketing process. What you don’t know WILL hurt you.

What was the return on investment (ROI) on the marketing campaign? If it cost you more than you made (or will ever make) on this campaign then it’s a failure. If it cost you less than the profits you made as result of the campaign then it’s a success.

Rather than “getting your name out there,” you’ll fare much better by concentrating on getting the name of your prospects in here.

One of the massive advantages of targeting a niche is that your marketing becomes much cheaper. Targeted advertising ends up being much cheaper than mass marketing because there is far less waste.

The money we make upfront on a campaign is known as the “**front end**.” The money we make on subsequent purchases is known as the “**back end**.” Together these figures make up the **lifetime value of a customer**.

You need to send the right message to the right target market, through the right media channel. Failing at any one of these three elements will likely cause your marketing campaign to fail.

As always with any marketing strategy it’s vitally important to find out where your prospects “hang out” and use the appropriate media to get your message through to them. Social media may or may not be one of those places they hang out.

Building a database of email subscribers plays a central role in your online marketing strategy. A prominent part of your website should be an email opt-in form. This enables you to capture the email address of website visitors and gives you the opportunity to nurture those visitors who may not be ready to buy immediately but who are interested and want more information.

Having a highly responsive list of email subscribers enables you to almost create cash on demand. You create a compelling offer with a response mechanism and send an email blast to your list. You’ll get instant feedback whether it’s a hit or a miss. It’s a great way of cheaply testing offers prior to investing in more expensive media such as print or pay-per-click advertising.

Here are some of the key dos and don’ts when it comes to email.

*   Don’t spam,
*   Use a commercial email marketing system.
*   Email regularly.
*   Give them value.
*   Automate.

Email is a very powerful and personal media channel. It allows you to create compelling campaigns with a high degree of automation. When done right it can be a valuable part of both an online and offline media strategy.

When it comes to your media strategy you should understand that email doesn’t replace postal mail, it complements it.

We all love the speed and efficiency of all things virtual; however, it would be a mistake to underestimate the power of physical objects when it comes to moving people emotionally. And moving people emotionally towards a desired action is what marketing is all about.

No discussion of marketing or spending on media can be complete without discussing **budget**. When spending money on marketing one of the following three things will occur:

1.  Your marketing fails (i.e. you make less in profit than you spent on your marketing expenses).
2.  You have no idea if your marketing was a success or failure because you don’t measure the results.
3.  Your marketing succeeds (i.e. you make more in profit than you spent on your marketing).

For each of these scenarios there’s a simple course of action:

If your marketing consistently fails and loses you money then STOP and change what you’re doing.

If you don’t measure your marketing results that’s just plain stupid because with the technology we have readily and cheaply available, it’s easier than ever to track your marketing results and return on investment (ROI).

If your marketing is working and consistently giving you a positive ROI, then you should crank it up and throw as much money as you can at it.

If your marketing is working (i.e. giving you a positive return on investment) why on earth would you limit it with a budget?

The only time to set a marketing budget is when you’re in the testing phase. In the testing phase I advocate that you fail often and fail cheap until you have a winner. Test your headline, your offer, your ad positioning and other variables. Then cut the losers and optimize the winners until you finally have a combination that gives you the best possible return on investment.

### ACT II — The “During” Phase

In the “during” phase you’re dealing with leads. **Leads** are people that know you and have indicated interest in what you have to offer by responding to your marketing message. In this phase you’ll capture these interested leads in a database system, nurture them with regular value-building information and convert them into paying customers.

The goal of this phase is to get your leads to like you and what you have to offer enough to buy from you for the first time. Once they’ve bought from you, they become a customer and enter the third and final phase of your marketing process.

#### Chapter 4 — Capturing Leads

**Capturing leads** in a database system for future follow-up is critical to your marketing success. This is because only a very small percentage of interested leads may be ready to purchase from you immediately. Lead capture is all about properly handling interest and building your future sales pipeline.

The vast majority will not be ready to make a purchasing decision on the very day they read your ad — even if they are interested in what you do.

All other things being equal, the more money you can spend marketing to high probability prospects, the better your chances are of converting them to a customer.

Remember the goal is simply to generate leads. Avoid the temptation of trying to sell from your ad. At this early stage you just want to sift out the uninterested and unmotivated so that you can build your database of high probability prospects.

</figure>

At the absolute center of your marketing infrastructure is your database of customers and prospects, but to manage your database effectively you really need a CRM system. The **CRM system** is your marketing nerve center. It’s where you manage your goldmine.

You want all your leads, all your customer interactions to end up in your CRM. This is where things get exciting.

#### Chapter 5 — Nurturing Leads

**Nurturing leads** is the process of taking people from being vaguely interested in what you have to offer to desiring it and wanting to do business with you. The lead nurturing process ensures that leads are interested, motivated, qualified and predisposed to buying from you before you ever try to sell to them.

When it comes to marketing, the money is in the follow-up. Based on this we build the irresistible lead nurturing model.

<figure>

![](/images2/the-1-page-marketing-plan-by-allan-dib-4.png)

</figure>

Immediately after you’ve captured a lead, they should go into your system where repeated contacts are made over time. These are not contacts where you obnoxiously try to pester them into buying. You build a relationship, giving them value in advance of them buying anything from you and in the process building trust and demonstrating authority in your field of expertise.

This growing list of prospects and the relationship you have with them will become the most valuable asset in your business. It’s the golden goose. Now when the prospect is finally ready to buy, you’re a welcome invited guest rather than a pest. The most important thing you can take away from this message is to become a **marketing farmer**. It’s a simple three step process:

1.  Advertise with the intention of finding people who are interested in what you do.
2.  Add them to your database.
3.  Continually nurture them and provide them with value.

If you become a “marketing farmer,” you’ll have a rich and continual harvest as your database grows in number and quality.

Instead of being a pest, I advocate becoming a welcome guest. Send your high probability prospects a continuous stream of value until they’re ready to buy. This could be in the form of tutorials, articles, case studies or even something as simple as a monthly newsletter that’s related to their area of interest. This builds trust, goodwill and positions you as an expert and educator rather than just a sales person going for the jugular.

A **shock and awe package** is essentially a physical box that you mail or deliver to prospects full of unique benefit-laden assets related to your business and industry.

A shock and awe pack should do three things:

1.  Give your prospect amazing, unexpected value.
2.  Position you as an expert and trusted authority in your field.
3.  Move your prospect further down the buying cycle than they would otherwise have been.

Don’t make the mistake of being cheap and efficient when it comes to wooing prospects. Shock and awe packages are a huge competitive advantage.

Being more prolific with your marketing will create a buzz in your business. Your clients and prospects will start to notice you more and you’ll start to cut through the clutter and fill up your sales pipeline.

It takes different “types” to make a business work. Here are the three major types that it takes:

*   **The Entrepreneur** — This is the ideas person or visionary. They see a problem or gap in the market and are willing to take risks so they can solve that problem for a profit. **They make it up.** E.g. Seeing a gap in the market for a particular product and hiring all the right people needed to get it up and running.
*   **The Specialist** — This is an implementer of your vision. They could be an engineer, a venture capitalist, a graphic designer. They take your vision, or part of it, and help make it reality. **They make it real**. e.g. Building the factory to produce the product, getting the tooling right, creating the product packaging.
*   **The Manager** — They come in every day and make sure things get done, work gets delivered and the vision is on track. **They make it recur**. Running the factory, making sure shipments get out on time, making sure quality is right.

A **marketing calendar** sets out what marketing activities have to happen on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual basis and you put those into your schedule like you would any other important business events.

#### Chapter 6 — Sales Conversion

**Sales conversion** is all about creating enough trust and demonstrating enough value to motivate interested leads to become paying customers. Positioning yourself correctly will make the sales conversion process easy and natural for both you and your customer.

Once you’ve reached a level of competence, the real profit comes from the way you market yourself.

Resolve to stop positioning yourself as a commodity and competing solely on price. The result to your bottom line will be phenomenal.

Selling suddenly becomes much easier and more pleasant when you are welcomed with open arms and when the prospect is deeply interested in what you have to offer.

You need to move towards the model of… educate, educate, educate. With education, you build trust. With education, you position yourself as an expert. With education you build relationships. With education you make the selling process easier for both buyer and seller.

Delaying the sale accomplishes two things. First, it shows you’re willing to give long before you take, which breaks down sales resistance. Second, it presents you as an educator and expert in your field.

Your guarantee should be very specific and address the fear or uncertainty that the prospect has about the transaction.

Offering too much choice can actually prevent sales. The psychology behind this finding is that people get caught like a deer in the headlights. Fear of making a suboptimal choice prevents them from making any choice at all.

A big benefit of the **ultra high ticket item** is that it makes the other variations in your product range look much more reasonably priced by comparison. A rule of thumb often used is that ten percent of your customer base would pay ten times more and one percent of your customers would pay one hundred times more. Make sure you’re not leaving money on the table by not having ultra high ticket items in your product mix.

A better option than discounting is to increase the value of your offering. Bundling in bonuses, increasing quantities or adding peripheral services can be of genuine value to your customer but cost you very little to do.

As a business owner you should make it abundantly clear to all staff that sales are the lifeblood of the business and that **everyone is in sales**.

It’s one of the most powerful ways to win more business and it’s based on the magic of “try before you buy.” Using this technique can dramatically boost your sales.

You need to offer your customers their preferred payment method — not yours.

### ACT III — The After” Phase

In the “after” phase you’re dealing with customers. **Customers** are people that like you and what you have to offer enough to have paid you money at least once. In this phase you’ll turn your customers into raving fans by delivering a world class experience. You’ll then find ways of doing more business with them and increasing their lifetime value. Finally you’ll create an environment where referrals continually come your way.

The goal of this final phase is to get your customers to trust you and buy more from you. This phase continues in an ongoing “virtuous cycle” where you deepen your relationship with customers, do more business with them and get more referrals.

#### Chapter 7 — Delivering A World Class Experience

By delivering a **world class experience**, you turn customers into a tribe of raving fans who want to buy from you repeatedly. To deliver this world class experience you need to implement systems in your business and make smart use of technology.

One of the things that separates extraordinary businesses from ordinary ones is that they lead tribes, tribes of raving fans — not just customers. In your business, a tribe member is a special type of customer. One that acts as a cheerleader and is actively conspiring for you success. Your tribe members amplify your marketing message and take it to heights you’d never be able to reach on your own with paid advertising.

A customer who buys a product or service and doesn’t use it or implement it correctly is highly likely to write it off as something that doesn’t work and that’s the last thing we want. At best it ends up being a one-off sale and at worst it ends up being labeled a scam. As ridiculous as someone calling treadmills a scam because they failed to actually use it, a consumer can do the same with your product or service.

So your job is now to find a way to sell what your prospects want but also give them what they need. To get them to take action and do what they need to do to get results may mean that you have to package things in a certain way. You may need to cut the process up into manageable bite-sized pieces so that it doesn’t seem so daunting.

Your customers don’t just want to be serviced. They want to be entertained. Give them what they want by creating a sense of theatre around your product.

Plain and simple the purpose of any new technology in your business is to eliminate friction. We want the fastest and easiest path to the sale, while increasing customer satisfaction.

Here’s the lesson — tell your audience about all the effort that goes into delivering your product or service. In your sales copy and even in your packaging give them the details of how you painstakingly prepare or manufacture your product. This applies equally if you deliver services. Tell them about your skills, how you acquired them, all the checks and balances you have in place and how you train your staff. The backstory to your product or service is an absolutely essential part of your marketing. Don’t let your efforts and skill go unnoticed. It gives them an assurance that there is substance and quality behind your product. This is especially important if you are pitching a premium product or service.

**Systems** allow mere mortals to run an extraordinary business.

There are four main types of business systems you need to create regardless of what type of business you’re in. You’re almost guaranteed to make a fortune if you can create scalable and replicable systems in these four areas of your business:

1.  **Marketing system** — Generate a consistent flow of leads into the business.
2.  **Sales system **— Lead nurturing, follow-up and conversion.
3.  **Fulfillment system** — The actual thing you do in exchange for the customer’s money.
4.  **Administration system **— Accounts, reception, human resources, etc. Support of all the other business functions.

The problem is that customers don’t find out how good your products and services are until they have bought from you. And if your marketing and sales systems aren’t in place, they will never buy in the first place and find out how good you are. It’s a vicious cycle.

There are numerous benefits to implementing systems in your business. Here are some of the most important:

*   It builds a valuable asset.
*   Leverage and scalability.
*   Consistency.
*   Lower labor costs.

Our goal is to eliminate the **biggest bottleneck from your business — YOU**. Even if you’re not looking to get out of your business immediately, the day will come when you need to take time off, want to go onto another venture, employ more staff or even sell your business. When the time comes you’ll be thankful you followed this advice.

When starting a business it’s important to think clearly and plan for how you will exit.

You’ll rarely make as much money running a business as you will selling one. The person or company who puts you out of business is your ultimate customer and satisfying them will result in the biggest pay day you’ll ever receive.

I can tell you one of the most important things a purchaser looks for and that you need to satisfy is **whether you HAVE a business or whether you ARE the business**. There’s an enormous difference. If your business can’t be operated without you, then it’s not a saleable asset and you’re stuck — regardless of how good or profitable it is.

#### Chapter 8 — Increasing Customer Lifetime Value

Increasing the **lifetime value** of existing customers is where the real money is made. To do this you need to have strategies and tactics for getting existing customers to do more business with you. You also need to know, manage and continually improve key numbers in your business.

Increasing revenue and more importantly profit from existing and past customers is far easier than getting new ones. A widely quoted statistic is that a person is 21 times more likely to buy from a business whom they’ve bought from in the past compared to one they’ve never purchased from

By not increasing your prices over a long period of time you’re effectively giving yourself a pay cut.

Because the prospect was not specifically shopping for your suggested add-ons they’re much less likely to be price sensitive to the item being attached.

When the prospect is “hot and heavy” and in the buying state of mind, they’ll be much more receptive to other offers to buy. This is your opportunity to bundle in a high margin add on. It gives the customer a better result and instantly increases your customer lifetime value.

Ascension campaigns should be a constant part of your marketing process. Very often customers stay on existing products or services even though they can benefit from and afford to move up.

Increasing the frequency with which your customers buy from you is another solid strategy for increasing lifetime value. There are many strategies for doing so but here are a few of my favorites:

*   Reminders.
*   Give them a reason to come back.
*   Help them buy repeatedly with subscriptions.

This list of past customers is of tremendous value because much of the hard work involved in getting prospects to know you, like and trust you has already been done. Now you just need to run a reactivation campaign to win them back. This is great for getting some quick wins and bringing in fast cash.

Marketing is a game where you need to constantly measure, manage and improve your numbers. You don’t need a long convoluted story. You just need the numbers because numbers tell us the whole story.

The difference between a customer who is just a transaction and one who is a raving fan is huge, even if the nominal dollar amount of the transaction is the same. This is because not all revenue is good and not all growth is good.

With the toxic customers taking up all your time and energy, it’s often the high value, respectful customers who suffer a lack of attention. Don’t give the squeaky wheels oil. Replace them.

#### Chapter 9 — Orchestrating And Stimulating Referrals

**Orchestrating and stimulating referrals** is an active process. Many businesses wish and hope for referrals but don’t have a deliberate system for making them happen. By implementing some simple tactics you can make the flow of referrals a more reliable part of your marketing process.

One of the best ways to get referrals is by straight out asking for them from customers for whom you’ve delivered a good result.

By increasing the reliability of word of mouth marketing, you take back control of your lead flow and build a solid foundation for rapid business growth.

Finding other complimentary businesses that your customer deals with before they deal with you can help you uncover untapped profits in your business. Setting up a **joint venture** (JV) arrangement with one or more of these businesses that is not in direct competition with you can be a cheap or free source of leads.

Look at who has your customers before you and after you and find ways of creating value in both directions. This can become an important source of new customers and new revenue for your business.

### Conclusion

</figure>

You need to make the mistakes, risk looking foolish and invest in yourself and your business. In my experience I’ve found that entrepreneurs fail to implement for one of the following three reasons:

Your view of time affects everything you do in your business. For the entrepreneur time is not money. **Value is money.** Time is just one of the inputs it takes to deliver value to the market. Make marketing a daily process. Create your own 1-Page Marketing Plan and most importantly implement the plan. Spend time daily doing business and building value.

Having a culture of innovation, anticipating what’s coming in your industry and running some skunkworks projects in your business will give your business a massive competitive advantage.

Remember, no one knows how good your products or services are until after the sale. Before they buy, they only know how good your marketing is. Put simply **the best marketer wins every time**.
